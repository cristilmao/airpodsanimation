# Airpods Animation
This repository showcases an impressive animation that closely replicates the captivating effect featured on the official Apple website for Airpods Pro. If you've ever been mesmerized by Apple's website animations and want to learn how they are achieved, this code provides a valuable insight.

## Description
The main highlight of this project is a beautifully orchestrated animation that displays a sequence of Airpods Pro images. As you scroll down the web page, the images smoothly transition, creating a stunning visual experience that mirrors Apple's web design finesse. The animation is achieved using HTML, CSS, and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), a powerful JavaScript animation library.

In addition to the image animation, the repository also includes a fixed "Airpods Pro" text overlay at the center of the screen. This text gradually fades into the background as you scroll, adding an extra layer of visual depth and elegance to the overall effect.
